 **Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset**

This project is part of my AI/ML internship tasks.
The goal is to explore a simple dataset, perform visual analysis, and understand important patterns and relationships between its features.

 1. **Task Objective**

The objective of this task is to:

Load and inspect a dataset

Understand the structure, shape, and summary of the data

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generate visualizations to identify relationships and patterns

Interpret insights from the dataset

2. **Dataset Used**

Dataset Name: Iris Dataset

Source: Built-in dataset from Seaborn (sns.load_dataset("iris"))

Total Samples: 150

Features (numerical):

sepal_length

sepal_width

petal_length

petal_width

Target Variable: species

Species Categories: setosa, versicolor, virginica

This dataset is widely used for classification tasks and introductory data exploration.

 3. **Models / Techniques Applied**

Since this is an EDA-focused task, no machine learning model is trained.
The following tools and techniques are applied:

✔ Tools / Libraries

Pandas — data loading and processing

NumPy — numeric operations

Seaborn — statistical plots

Matplotlib — visualizations

✔ Analysis Techniques

Dataset inspection (head, info, describe)

Scatter plots for feature comparison

Histograms for feature distribution

Boxplots for outlier detection

Species-wise pattern analysis

 4.**Key Results & Findings**
 From Visualizations:

Setosa is clearly separable from the other two species based on petal measurements.

Petal length and petal width show the strongest class separation.

Histograms show that most features follow a normal-like distribution.

**Boxplots reveal:**

Variation in ranges between species

Very few outliers

Dataset contains no missing values and is clean for modeling.
