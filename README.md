a-Simple-Dataset
 **Objective**

To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset, understand feature distributions, analyze patterns between variables, and visualize species-wise differences.

📊 **Dataset Used**

**Name:** Iris Dataset

**Source:** Built-in dataset from the seaborn library

**Total Samples:** 150

**Total Features:** 4 numerical + 1 categorical

**Features:**
sepal_length

sepal_width

petal_length

petal_width

Target Label: species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

 **Techniques & Models Applied**

This task focuses on data exploration, so no ML model training was performed.
The following tools and techniques were used:

**Tools / Libraries**

Pandas → Data loading, inspection, summary statistics

NumPy → Numerical calculations

Matplotlib & Seaborn → Visualizations and pattern detection

**Analysis Techniques**

Scatter plots

Histograms

Box plots

Descriptive statistics

Dataset structure & information checks

 **Key Results & Findings**

The Setosa species forms a very distinct cluster, especially in petal measurements.

Petal length and petal width are the strongest indicators for class separation.

Most features follow a normal-like distribution.

Boxplots reveal:

Variation in spread between species

Minimal outliers

The dataset is clean, containing no missing values.
